# Tasks App

A React application to set / edit / delete tasks.

## Live Demo

[Tasks App](https://tasks-app-hazel.vercel.app/)

## Details

After making a [Feedback app](https://github.com/Dimterion/Feedback-app) I've decided to play around with its code and remake it into something else.

It ended up being this Tasks App to keep track of your ToDos, edit and delete them.

The app uses local storage to save the tasks within the current browser.

Additional features may be added in the future.

## Built with

React, React Router, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Prettier
